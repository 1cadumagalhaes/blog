# This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.
I don't want my posts to be behind any paywall on other servers. My blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data.
